## Find Pairs memory game
Findpairs robot-player implemented using Robot Framework. This requires Find Pairs [webserver](https://github.com/git-vphakala/fp-py-server).

This robot learns the board when the cards are turned during the game. It does not investigate the board from the html.
Its memory is perfect: if another card of the pair has been turned on a previous round then the robot will find it.
